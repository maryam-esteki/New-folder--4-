    <div class="box">Here are the basic guidelines for keeping parrots as pets in English:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Proper Cage Size: Parrots need a spacious cage that allows them to move around freely, stretch their wings, and engage in natural behaviors like climbing and playing.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Balanced Diet: Provide a balanced diet including pellets, fresh fruits, vegetables, and seeds. Avoid foods like avocado, chocolate, and caffeine as they can be toxic to parrots.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Clean Environment: Keep the cage and surrounding area clean. Regularly change bedding, water, and food to prevent bacteria and infections.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Mental Stimulation: Parrots are highly intelligent and need mental stimulation. Provide toys, puzzles, and time outside the cage for interaction and exploration.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Social Interaction: Parrots are social animals and need regular interaction with their owners. Spend time talking, playing, and bonding with your parrot every day.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. Exercise: Allow your parrot time outside the cage to fly or explore under supervision to ensure they stay healthy and active.
        <br>
        <br>
        7. Health Care: Schedule regular check-ups with an avian veterinarian and watch for signs of illness like changes in behavior, appetite, or droppings.
        <br>
        <br>
        8. Safe Environment: Keep your parrot away from toxic fumes like Teflon, smoke, and household cleaners. Ensure the room is safe from potential hazards like open windows or sharp objects.
        <br>
        <br>
        9. Training: Training your parrot helps with behavior management and strengthens the bond between you and your pet. Basic commands and social skills are important.
        <br>
        <br>
        10. Commitment: Parrots live for a long time (some species for up to 80 years), so owning one is a long-term commitment.</div>
